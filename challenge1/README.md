first challenge
The function first prompts the user to input student marks and converts the input to a floating-point number using parseFloat(). Then it checks whether the input is valid (i.e., between 0 and 100). If the input is valid, it checks the mark against different grade boundaries using a series of if-else statements and returns the corresponding grade. 


second challenge
The program defines a function calculateDemeritPoints that takes the speed of a car as input. The program first defines two constants: speedLimit (which is set to 70) and kmPerPoint (which is set to 5). If the speed of the car is less than or equal to the speed limit, the program prints "Ok" and returns. Otherwise, it calculates the number of demerit points based on the speed of the car using the formula (speed - speedLimit) / kmPerPoint, and rounds the result down to the nearest integer using Math.floor(). If the number of demerit points is greater than 12, the program prints "License suspended". Otherwise, it prints the number of demerit points.
